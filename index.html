    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you told me 5 years ago I would have a home birth in the future, I would&rsquo;ve
            been horrified. I&rsquo;ve had some big mental shifts on all things regarding pregnancy and labor and
            delivery throughout the course of my 4 children. With Micah and Nora, I was terrified of giving birth and
            wanted to numb myself. I felt if I could be unconscious, that would be the best way to do it. I was very
            fortunate to have straightforward births with them, and a completely adequate hospital experience. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With my third baby, Gracie, I wanted to do things differently. Recognizing that I had
            a ton of fear surrounding childbirth, I knew I needed to address that. I didn&rsquo;t want fear to be my
            motivation for seeking out a hospital birth with an epidural. If I had a long labor and needed to rest, that
            was another story, but I was using the epidural to numb myself and my fear which I didn&rsquo;t feel was a
            good enough reason for this birth. So I got a doula and did a lot of mental prep work preparing myself for
            my first unmedicated birth in the hospital. It was wonderful, and a great experience. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had no medical interventions with Gracie, so we had talked about the possibility of
            giving birth at home with our next baby. I felt I was a good candidate physically; having no medical
            complications and each labor getting slightly faster and easier- thank you, God! The idea of not having to
            drive to the hospital while in labor, and being able to sleep in my own bed right after birth very much
            appealed to me. Plus, we live close to the hospital should we need to go there. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were some things that did not appeal to me though, the biggest one being the
            fact that I have 3 other young (and often challenging) children to manage. My hospital stay in the past has
            honestly felt like a vacation. No laundry, meals brought to you, and just one newborn to care for. I did not
            want my kids present for the birth; that idea stressed me out. Our plan was that if I went into labor at
            night, we would leave the kids alone to sleep, but if I began labor during the day, one of the grandparents
            would take them, thankfully both sets are in town. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This fourth pregnancy was by far my easiest. I had the least amount of
            nausea/vomiting and felt physically very well. I have been so grateful pregnancy has been relatively easy
            for me; such a gift, and one I know I do not deserve. But like every other mom, I was anxious for baby to be
            on the outside. My due date of July 23rd came and went, and so did too many other days for my liking. My
            biggest disappointment was that my parents left for their weeklong trip to Norway on July 29th, and I was
            still pregnant. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">On Monday, July 31st, I texted my midwives saying that after my appointment I had
            scheduled with them on Wednesday, I would be open to doing a membrane sweep and try midwives brew to help
            kickstart labor. They responded by saying they were both free that evening if we would like to plan a
            &ldquo;labor party&rdquo; for that night. I checked in with James and we both agreed. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">My favorite part about this was having a plan. It brought me so much peace to be able
            to pack up the kids and send them to my wonderful in-laws house for a sleepover, and James and I could focus
            on hoping labor would start. Our midwives were waiting on call.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Previously, I had never been one to want to be induced because I&rsquo;ve honestly
            never felt &ldquo;done&rdquo; being pregnant. I often feel much worse physically postpartum so I
            didn&rsquo;t feel the need to rush into that phase. But I also had a great friend/ postpartum doula
            scheduled to come later that week, and I wanted to have a baby in my arms as I was now 41 weeks. I was also
            very skeptical of any labor induction strategies as none of them had historically seemed to work for me.
            Yet, the midwives did tell me that they&rsquo;ve had great success with this drink before, so I was willing
            to give it a shot. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midwives brew was something I&rsquo;ve never heard of before, but it&rsquo;s a drink
            you blend together. Apricot juice, lemon verbena tea, almond butter and castor oil. Thankfully only 2 tbs of
            castor oil, so it&rsquo;s not going to send you immediately to the toilet. Before taking this, I had a brief
            appointment with my midwife to make sure I was a favorable candidate; a certain percentage dilated and
            effaced, and I was. I headed back home, James was bringing the 3 kids to his parents, and I blended up my
            drink and finished it at 6:15pm. It tasted very good!</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">James and I then went for a walk and I curb walked, and did a bunch of stairs hoping
            to help get into labor land. I am now downright crabby. I was thinking there&rsquo;s no way this will work.
            We planned a whole evening with the kids gone, the midwives waiting, and nothing will happen. It&rsquo;s
            just a silly drink. Then around 8:45pm, I started to have some contractions as we arrived back home. I
            started timing them on my app and they were pretty immediately intense (I couldn&rsquo;t talk through them)
            and coming quickly. My phone alerted me that I should go to the hospital :) </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We let our team know, and James started filling up the birth pool. The midwives
            arrived at our house around 10:15pm and I knew I was in full blown labor. Honestly, I was feeling very
            surprised that the drink worked haha. We had a birth room set up with everything in it a few weeks earlier,
            so we moved into that room. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It felt very good to get into the tub, although I will say this labor felt more
            intense than Gracie&rsquo;s did. My contractions felt super challenging, but we were doing it. I was hoping
            my water would break soon as I was assuming that would bring some pressure relief. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, I felt the fetal ejection reflex. I experienced this for the first time with
            Gracie, which is essentially where your body pushes out the baby involuntarily, and you are not having to do
            forced pushing. I felt my water pop in the pool, and the ring of fire felt much more intense than I remember
            it feeling with Grace. The pushing happened quite quickly, I enjoy that part for the fact that pain from the
            contractions lets up tremendously for me. It was so wild to feel baby&rsquo;s head, and then the whole body
            slipped out and was handed right up to me, and I was very relieved this part was over. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy, &#39;&#39; I said outloud. I had been leaning over the side
            of the tub/ on my knees to deliver him and now moved to sitting and getting to look all over this wonderful
            baby that we just brought into the world inside our house. We had the name Blaise picked out for months, so
            I was excited to introduce our midwives to him. He was so mellow and sleepy, which they assured me is more
            common for babies born in the water. He was absolutely covered in vernix, much more than my other 3. So much
            birthday frosting! </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was born at 12:45am on Tuesday, August 1st. Four hours of labor, and only 6.5
            hours after drinking the midwives brew. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a few minutes, I was assisted out of the tub and got to move right into my own
            bed. My wonderful team of two midwives cleaned up everything; the whole birth pool/room, the bathroom, the
            kitchen, leaving everything better than how they found it. All the while, I was dozing in bed with a nursing
            baby. They came into our room at the foot of the bed to assess him as well as weigh and measure. He was our
            biggest baby, weighing 9lb 9oz and 23.5 inches long! I&rsquo;ve hardly heard of a baby so long. </span></p>

    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The midwives left around 3:30am after making sure we had absolutely everything we
            needed. It was such a wonderful experience to feel so well taken care of, so peaceful and so relaxed being
            in our bed together with the freshest little baby. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are so grateful to all our friends and family who supported us on this journey and
            made it possible. It truly takes a village. Thank you God for the gift of new life, and for filling our
            hearts with peace about the idea of home birth. It was such an amazing experience! </span></p>
