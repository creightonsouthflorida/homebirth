        <h1>Previous births</h1>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you told me 5 years ago I would have a home birth in the future, I
                        would&rsquo;ve
                        been horrified. I&rsquo;ve had some big mental shifts on all things regarding pregnancy and
                        labor and
                        delivery throughout the course of my 4 children. With Micah and Nora, I was terrified of giving
                        birth and
                        wanted to numb myself. I felt if I could be unconscious, that would be the best way to do it. I
                        was very
                        fortunate to have straightforward births with them, and a completely adequate hospital
                        experience. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With my third baby, Gracie, I wanted to do things differently. Recognizing that I
                        had
                        a ton of fear surrounding childbirth, I knew I needed to address that. I didn&rsquo;t want fear
                        to be my
                        motivation for seeking out a hospital birth with an epidural. If I had a long labor and needed
                        to rest, that
                        was another story, but I was using the epidural to numb myself and my fear which I didn&rsquo;t
                        feel was a
                        good enough reason for this birth. So I got a doula and did a lot of mental prep work preparing
                        myself for
                        my first unmedicated birth in the hospital. It was wonderful, and a great experience. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had no medical interventions with Gracie, so we had talked about the
                        possibility of
                        giving birth at home with our next baby. I felt I was a good candidate physically; having no
                        medical
                        complications and each labor getting slightly faster and easier- thank you, God! The idea of not
                        having to
                        drive to the hospital while in labor, and being able to sleep in my own bed right after birth
                        very much
                        appealed to me. Plus, we live close to the hospital should we need to go there. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        
        <h1>My biggest reservation</h1>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were some things that did not appeal to me though, the biggest one being
                        the
                        fact that I have 3 other young (and often challenging) children to manage. My hospital stay in
                        the past has
                        honestly felt like a vacation. No laundry, meals brought to you, and just one newborn to care
                        for. I did not
                        want my kids present for the birth; that idea stressed me out. Our plan was that if I went into
                        labor at
                        night, we would leave the kids alone to sleep, but if I began labor during the day, one of the
                        grandparents
                        would take them, thankfully both sets are in town. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This fourth pregnancy was by far my easiest. I had the least amount of
                        nausea/vomiting and felt physically very well. I have been so grateful pregnancy has been
                        relatively easy
                        for me; such a gift, and one I know I do not deserve. But like every other mom, I was anxious
                        for baby to be
                        on the outside. My due date of July 23rd came and went, and so did too many other days for my
                        liking. My
                        biggest disappointment was that my parents left for their weeklong trip to Norway on July 29th,
                        and I was
                        still pregnant. </span></p>

        <h1>Midwives brew</h1>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"> On Monday, July 31st, I texted my midwives saying that after my appointment I had
                        scheduled with them on Wednesday, I would be open to doing a membrane sweep and try midwives
                        brew to help
                        kickstart labor. They responded by saying they were both free that evening if we would like to
                        plan a
                        &ldquo;labor party&rdquo; for that night. I checked in with James and we both agreed. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">My favorite part about this was having a plan. It brought me so much peace to be
                        able
                        to pack up the kids and send them to my wonderful in-laws house for a sleepover, and James and I
                        could focus
                        on hoping labor would start. Our midwives were waiting on call.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Previously, I had never been one to want to be induced because I&rsquo;ve
                        honestly
                        never felt &ldquo;done&rdquo; being pregnant. I often feel much worse physically postpartum so I
                        didn&rsquo;t feel the need to rush into that phase. But I also had a great friend/ postpartum
                        doula
                        scheduled to come later that week, and I wanted to have a baby in my arms as I was now 41 weeks.
                        I was also
                        very skeptical of any labor induction strategies as none of them had historically seemed to work
                        for me.
                        Yet, the midwives did tell me that they&rsquo;ve had great success with this drink before, so I
                        was willing
                        to give it a shot. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"> Midwives brew was something I&rsquo;ve never heard of before, but it&rsquo;s a
                        drink
                        you blend together. Apricot juice, lemon verbena tea, almond butter and castor oil. Thankfully
                        only 2 tbs of
                        castor oil, so it&rsquo;s not going to send you immediately to the toilet. Before taking this, I
                        had a brief
                        appointment with my midwife to make sure I was a favorable candidate; a certain percentage
                        dilated and
                        effaced, and I was. I headed back home, James was bringing the 3 kids to his parents, and I
                        blended up my
                        drink and finished it at 6:15pm. It tasted very good!</span></p>
        <h1>Early labor</h1>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">James and I then went for a walk and I curb walked, and did a bunch of stairs
                        hoping
                        to help get into labor land. I am now downright crabby. I was thinking there&rsquo;s no way this
                        will work.
                        We planned a whole evening with the kids gone, the midwives waiting, and nothing will happen.
                        It&rsquo;s
                        just a silly drink. Then around 8:45pm, I started to have some contractions as we arrived back
                        home. I
                        started timing them on my app and they were pretty immediately intense (I couldn&rsquo;t talk
                        through them)
                        and coming quickly. My phone alerted me that I should go to the hospital :) </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We let our team know, and James started filling up the birth pool. The midwives
                        arrived at our house around 10:15pm and I knew I was in full blown labor. Honestly, I was
                        feeling very
                        surprised that the drink worked haha. We had a birth room set up with everything in it a few
                        weeks earlier,
                        so we moved into that room. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It felt very good to get into the tub, although I will say this labor felt more
                        intense than Gracie&rsquo;s did. My contractions felt super challenging, but we were doing it. I
                        was hoping
                        my water would break soon as I was assuming that would bring some pressure relief. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h1>The fetal ejection reflex</h1>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, I felt the fetal ejection reflex. I experienced this for the first time
                        with
                        Gracie, which is essentially where your body pushes out the baby involuntarily, and you are not
                        having to do
                        forced pushing. I felt my water pop in the pool, and the ring of fire felt much more intense
                        than I remember
                        it feeling with Grace. The pushing happened quite quickly, I enjoy that part for the fact that
                        pain from the
                        contractions lets up tremendously for me.

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">
                        It was so wild to feel baby&rsquo;s head, and then the
                        whole body
                        slipped out and was handed right up to me, and I was very relieved this part was over. This photo above is an amazing shot my midwife got when his head was out. You can see his face under the water!</span>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy!&#39;&#39; I said outloud. I had been leaning over the
                        side
                        of the tub/ on my knees to deliver him and now moved to sitting and getting to look all over
                        this wonderful
                        baby that we just brought into the world inside our house. We had the name Blaise picked out for
                        months, so
                        I was excited to introduce our midwives to him. He was so mellow and sleepy, which they assured
                        me is more
                        common for babies born in the water. He was absolutely covered in vernix, much more than my
                        other 3. So much
                        birthday frosting! </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was born at 12:45am on Tuesday, August 1st. Four hours of labor, and only 6.5
                        hours after drinking the midwives brew. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a few minutes, I was assisted out of the tub and got to move right into my
                        own
                        bed. My wonderful team of two midwives cleaned up everything; the whole birth pool/room, the
                        bathroom, the
                        kitchen, leaving everything better than how they found it. All the while, I was dozing in bed
                        with a nursing
                        baby. They came into our room at the foot of the bed to assess him as well as weigh and measure.
                        He was our
                        biggest baby, weighing 9lb 9oz and 23.5 inches long! I&rsquo;ve hardly heard of a baby so long.

                        needed. It was such a wonderful experience to feel so well taken care of, so peaceful and so
                        relaxed being
                        in our bed together with the freshest little baby. </span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are so grateful to all our friends and family who supported us on this journey
                        and
                        made it possible. It truly takes a village. Thank you God for the gift of new life, and for
                        filling our
                        hearts with peace about the idea of home birth. It was such an amazing experience! </span></p>
